Description:

This website is meant to act as a more detailed and interactive version of my resume. This is my professional and academic portfolio. I want my website to be clean and professional, which is why I chose to use a blue and gray color scheme and include a structured grid for many of my graphics and information. This is because my target audience is potential employers. The audience should be able to quickly find the information they need without too many distractions. Through this website users can learn about my educational, professional, and extracurricular background.They will have a thorough look at my recent works and why I would be a good candidate to employ. 
I used animations to engage the audience. For example users can hover over my projects to make the image flip over and display text describing what the project was about. They can interact with slides by clicking on buttons and changing images. They can also navigate to different pages with many visual cues leading them as they do.


d. Using your website: 

- Navigation Bar: Users can hover over the navigation bar to see which is selected and then click on the different tabs to navigate to those pages
- Flip cards on the project page: Hover over each projects image to make the image flip over and display text describing what the project was about.
-Publications and Conferences page slide show:Use the two arrows at the bottom of slide show to navigate beween slides.
-Watching other animations: Uses can refesh the page and scroll through to any of the other pages to see aditional animations.


e. External libraries: 

I used bootstrap. I chose to use this so that my website will work on different sized devices. I used it by defining a grid. It adds structure to my website.

I used a css library from w3schools. I chose to use this to help with the style of my slideshows. I used it for the slide shows on the extracuricular pages. It adds a fade effect to the slides.


f. Iteration from HW7:

From HW7 I made a few changes. The first is for the home page I decided to keep to not use the bubble selector and instead keep consistent with the side bar after receiving that feedback from my TA. In addition I also specified the exact animations that I wantes to include. Some of these animations are two different types of slide shows, a typed animated header for each page, and cards that flip over.



g. Major challenges:

Some of the major challenges I faced was implementing animations. This took me many hours because I faced bugs in the slide show animations. These bugs resulted in only one slide show working at a time or displaying all images at once. I was able to overcome these challenges by localizing where the the problem was coming from and trying different solutions to see which worked the best.
